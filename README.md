# What does a MAC address Changer do?
Changing the assigned MAC address may allow the user to bypass access control lists on servers or routers, either hiding a computer on a network or allowing it to impersonate another network device. However, MAC spoofing does not work when trying to bypass parental controls if automatic MAC filtering is turned on.

# WHAT IS MAC ADDRESS?
